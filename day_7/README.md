## Day 7: Create a website!

## Open your local copy of fe-m1-practice in Atom

In the day_7 directory, create a file called `day7-exercises.md`. This is where you'll put your answers to the following questions.

## User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX)

*   There is a great series of UI/UX posts called [UX Crash Course: 31 Fundamentals](http://thehipperelement.com/post/75476711614/ux-crash-course-31-fundamentals). Read the first three, short posts: What is UX?, User Goals & Business Goals, and The 5 Main Ingredients of UX.
*   After you're done reading the third post, read through the each section of questions again: Psychology, Usability, Design, Copywriting, and Analysis. Choose one question from each of these sections (so 5 total questions), and find one site that is good at supporting that question, and find another site that violates that question.

  * Post links to the sites and brief descriptions in your `day7-exercises.md` file.

## Make A New Webpage Using Atom!

Instead of using CodePen to create this webpage, let's use Atom - our text editor. Within this directory, create another directory called `my_website`.

Within the `my_website` directory, create two files:

*   `index.html` to hold your HTML code
*   `style.css` to hold your CSS code

Your site should contain (but is not limited to):

*   Content about a subject you are passionate about! (something not about coding)
*   Headings
*   Text in paragraphs (include two different fonts)
*   Links
*   Images
*   A list (ordered or unordered)
*   A form
*   Usage of color

To see the HTML code that you've written in the browser, you can run `open index.html` from the command line. Don't forget to link your stylesheet in your `index.html` file!

If you're having trouble using Atom to create a webpage, then go ahead and use CodePen to get something built for your new site, but we would prefer that you use Atom.
