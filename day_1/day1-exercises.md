I don't have the book in question so I'm going to do a kinda best guess attempt on this.
1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
- It's basically instructions for how to format/read the contents of the page.
2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?
- Tags are how we specify an element.
3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
- To differentiate it from other parts of the page though also in practice to give us hooks for the css and javascript to act on.
4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
- The head contains a lot of information that's machine readable but not immediately visible to the user. The title gives you what appears in the menu bar/tab/wherever the title is shown in the browser of your choice the body is where the lion's share of the actual content for the user is located.
5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
- you can right click and select view page source or use the keyboard combination Option+Command+U
6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
- img for images
- h1 h2 and etc... are used to make headers with various sizes and styles.
- br makes a single line break.
- a href gets you links.
- ul creates an unordered list like this.
7.  What are empty elements?
- html elements with nothing inside of them. "<div></div>" for example
8.  What is semantic markup?
- It's using tags that mirror the meaning of your page rather than the structure. You could do most things with html/css/js you'd like to do with a series of divs but semantic markup means you use tags like article or footer or aside to help specify what the meaning of that part of the page is.
9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
- article, nav, aside.
